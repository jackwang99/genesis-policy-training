# Kafka Tool 2.01

Website: http://www.kafkatool.com/download.html

Traits of Kafka Tool include:

* Shows topics and consumers (automatic)
* Shows key and message contents
* Can add message to cluster
* Can not edit, delete, or clean
* Can export

To be able to see JSON message data:

* Reconfigure Topic key and message content types from Byte Array to String,
* Change message content viewing from Text to Json.

Note that Kafka Tool uses the hostname “kafka” to resolve kafka broker, so /etc/hosts or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts needs to contain a record with the Kafka broker IP and hostname kafka.

# Trifecta UI 0.22.0rc10c-0.8.2.0

* Website: https://github.com/ldaniels528/trifecta/
* Binary releases: https://github.com/ldaniels528/trifecta/releases

Traits of Trifecta include:

* Displays topics and messages with key/message and consumers (not automatic, need to define in config).
* Can use KSQL language to search through streams: https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/blob/v0.5/docs/syntax-reference.md#syntax-reference
* Compared to Kafka Tool, it is easier to read and post new messages
* If Zookeeper and Kafka are running on localhost, no other configuration is needed, the UI just picks them up. 

To use Trifecta, you will need to put in a short path (i.e. D:/trifecta) in order to start the application.

Known issues:

* In rc10, there are some bugs where native Kafka consumers are not displayed.
* In rc6, /api/consumers shows native Kafka consumers, but the UI does not, so you will need to match the version to the Kafka version.

Configuration can be found at %UserProfile%\.trifecta\config.properties.
