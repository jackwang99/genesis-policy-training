# Create ExtendedGeoCoord. In the previous exercise, the entity was created without extending anything. Now create an ExtendedGeoCoord entity by extending the GeoCoord base type:
```
    Entity ExtendedGeoCoord is GeoCoord {
     @Min(0.00)
     @Max(4.00)
     @Required
     Attr latitude: Decimal
     @Min(0.00)
     @Max(5.00)
     Attr additionalLatitudeAccuracy: Decimal
    }
```
This entity:
* Overrides the base type
* Sets a max value of 4.00 for latitude
* Adds an additional attribute additionalLatitudeAccuracy

# Add the extended entity to PersonalAutoPolicySummary so that it's saved as another embedded table.
```
    Entity PersonalAutoPolicySummary is AutoPolicySummary {
     <..>
     @Embedded
     Ref extendedGeoCoord: ExtendedGeoCoord 
     <..>
    }
```
# Recompile, redeploy and re-run the applications. 
If you look at the database structure and check how ExtendedGeoCoord is saved compared to AdditionalPolicyData, you will see that it is in a different table. For Attr, there is only a column. For Ref, there is a new table.
